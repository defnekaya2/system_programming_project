## Docker (Week 3)

The Dockerfile is configured to build the C++ application inside the container
using CMake and libpqxx.

Note: The build step requires the presence of `CMakeLists.txt`, `src/`, and
`include/` directories, which are provided in the `defnekaya-week2-cpp-db`
branch. This branch prepares the Dockerfile structure in advance for integration.
