#Student Information System
## Development Workflow
- All changes are made in feature branches
- Direct push to main and develop is disabled
- All changes are merged via Pull Requests
- Also after push operations unnecessary branches are deleted

### Branch Protection Verification

-A direct push attempt to the main branch was intentionally performed
to verify branch protection rules.
-GitHub explicitly logged the violation and allowed an admin bypass,
confirming that changes are enforced via Pull Requests.
